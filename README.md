# Overview
Thank you for checking out this analysis of GDP and Life Expectancy data from the World Health Organization! While there were no particularly shocking findings, it was a good exercise in data visualization.
This data was analyzed in Python using the seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, and pandas libraries.

# Takeaways
GDP and Life Expectancy are positively correlated for each country, but after a certain amount of GDP for a country, further increases barely affect its Life Expectancy at all.

# Limitations
There were only six countries in this dataset, and not many other variables measured. A larger dataset with more countries and variables might elucidate more causal factors and therefore better inform the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
